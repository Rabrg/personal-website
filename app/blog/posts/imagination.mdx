Imagination is the the mind reaching out to new heights. Beauty is what is found. Art is created when the beauty is
brought back down.

Art inspires others to reach. A single reach extends the height of everybody. The beauty in the art created by a
reach is nothing compared to the beauty that the art makes reachable.

Genius is the capacity to reach. The greatness of the genius is not in the beauty of the art that he creates: it is in
the beauty that he makes reachable. The genius's greatest creation is genius.

Each musing is a muse; each reach extends the reachable. The greatness of the genius is his immortalization as a muse.
