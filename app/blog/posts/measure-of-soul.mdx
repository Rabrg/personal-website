A soul's size is proportional to the amount of external World internalized within it.

Internalization is the result of understanding; understanding is the integration of World and soul.
The larger the aspect of World, the more its internalization enlarges the soul once understood.

Empathy is the understanding of another soul. When a soul understands another's,
it gains the other's size proportional to its understanding of that soul:
World becomes understood through the understanding of souls that understand it.

The faculties of reason, creativity, and intuition grow souls by allowing souls to understand World.
Language, society, and culture grow souls by allowing souls to understand each other.

The greatest duty of a soul is to grow its size: not for the end of enlarging itself,
but for the means of enlarging all those who understand it.
A soul that does not understand nor is understood by others is only as large as itself.

The greatest duty of a soul is to enlarge all others.
