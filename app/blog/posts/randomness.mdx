The concept of randomness is purely theoretical, and does not exist in Nature. The appearance of randomness is caused by looking from a vantage point of insufficient understanding: an inability to see the underlying patterns.

To understand is to see beyond the veil of randomness. What lies beyond the veil is not random, but patterns beyond the grasp of today's understanding. The more complex the patterns, the more deceptive the veil, and the greater the understanding needed to see beyond it.

The veil is not the end of understanding, but its beginning.
