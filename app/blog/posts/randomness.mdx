The concept of randomness is purely theoretical, and does not exist in Nature. The appearance of randomness is caused by an insufficient understanding: an insufficient ability to see the underlying patterns.

To understand is to see beyond the veil of randomness. What lies beyond the veil is not truly randomness, but complexity beyond the grasp of today's understanding. The greater the complexity, the more deceptive the veil, and the greater the understanding needed to see beyond it.

The veil is not the end of understanding, but its beginning.
